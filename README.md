Carousel Photo Display

____________________________________

This project is the result of a challenge to produce a page that will
display images in a carousel style, with a minimum of fuss.

This code does not use any libraries. Instead, only vanilla JavaScript and
css are used to position the elements.

In the future, I would like to go ahead and use jQuery to add animation in order
for the display to suggest more of a carnival carousel ride, as the user advances
and reverses the image display.
